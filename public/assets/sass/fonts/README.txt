Hiya
These .woff2 files are fonts, specifically webfonts that I embedded into the scss.
If you move them (don't delete them please) you'll have to change the file path in the scss file (compile it after please) or they won't work.

N.B. The logo font (grafita) is illegally  edited by yours truly so if you ever want to use for wte reason, get the original version. 
     Not sure if it was actually illegal but safety first kiddos. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
