Hiya 
This folder has all the scss/css. I didn't write a whole lot but if you do want to change any of it:
1. download sass with homebrew in your terminal 
2. get 'live sass compiler' extension here in vscode 
3. make changes
4. 'watch' the sass(bottom bar), wait a few seconds (2-3)
5. stop watching the sass 
6. reload page 
viola!

N.B. any changes made to the .css file will NOT work, do NOT interfere with the .css.map ｡◕‿‿◕｡
